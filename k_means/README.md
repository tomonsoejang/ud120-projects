# K-means Clustering Mini Project

In this project, we’ll apply k-means clustering to our Enron financial data. Our final goal, of course, is to identify persons of interest; since we have labeled data, this is not a question that particularly calls for an unsupervised approach like k-means clustering.

Nonetheless, you’ll get some hands-on practice with k-means in this project, and play around with feature scaling, which will give you a sneak preview of the next lesson’s material.
