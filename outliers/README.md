# Outlier Mini Project

This project has two parts. In the first part, you will run a regression, and identify and remove the 10% of points that have the largest residual errors. Then youâ€™ll remove those outliers from the dataset and refit the regression, just like the strategy that Sebastian suggested in the lesson videos.

In the second part, you will get acquainted with some of the outliers in the Enron finance data, and learn if/how to remove them.
