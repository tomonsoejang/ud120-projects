# Test Learning Mini Project

In the beginning of this class, you identified emails by their authors using a number of supervised classification algorithms. In those projects, we handled the preprocessing for you, transforming the input emails into a TfIdf so they could be fed into the algorithms. Now you will construct your own version of that preprocessing step, so that you are going directly from raw data to processed features.

You will be given two text files: one contains the locations of all the emails from Sara, the other has emails from Chris. You will also have access to the parseOutText() function, which accepts an opened email as an argument and returns a string containing all the (stemmed) words in the email.




## Warming Up with parseOutText()

Youâ€™ll start with a warmup exercise to get acquainted with parseOutText(). Go to the tools directory and run parse_out_email_text.py, which contains parseOutText() and a test email to run this function over.

parseOutText() takes the opened email and returns only the text part, stripping away any metadata that may occur at the beginning of the email, so what's left is the text of the message. We currently have this script set up so that it will print the text of the email to the screen, **what is the text that you get when you run parseOutText()?**


**A hint when submitting**: the words in the string that you get have TWO spaces between them; make sure your answer does too!

##### Answer: 
```Hi Everyone  If you can read this message youre properly using parseOutText  Please proceed to the next part of the project```
