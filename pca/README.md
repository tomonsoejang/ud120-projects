## PCA Mini-Project

Our discussion of PCA spent a lot of time on theoretical issues, so in this mini-project weâ€™ll ask you to play around with some sklearn code. The eigenfaces code is interesting and rich enough to serve as the testbed for this entire mini-project.

The starter code can be found in `pca/eigenfaces.py`. This was mostly taken from the example found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/applications/plot_face_recognition.html), on the sklearn documentation.

Take note when running the code, that there are changes in one of the parameters for the SVC function called on line 94 of pca/eigenfaces.py. For the 'class_weight' parameter, the argument string "auto" is a valid value for sklearn version 0.16 and prior, but will be depreciated by 0.19. If you are running sklearn version 0.17 or later, the expected argument string should be "balanced". If you get an error or warning when running pca/eigenfaces.py, make sure that you have the correct argument on line 98 that matches your installed version of sklearn.
