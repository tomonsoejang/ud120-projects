# Evaluation Mini Project
## Applying metric to your POI Identifier

Go back to your code from the last lesson, where you built a simple first iteration of a POI identifier using a decision tree and one feature. Copy the POI identifier that you built into the skeleton code in evaluation/evaluate_poi_identifier.py. Recall that at the end of that project, your identifier had an accuracy (on the test set) of 0.724. Not too bad, right? Letâ€™s dig into your predictions a little more carefully.
